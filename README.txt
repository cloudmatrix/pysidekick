PySideKick:  helpful utilities for working with PySide
======================================================


This package is a rather ad-hoc collection of helpers, utilities and custom
widgets for building applications with PySide.  So far we have:

  * PySideKick.Call:  helpers for calling functions in a variety of ways,
                      e.g. qCallAfter, qCallInMainThread

  * PySideKick.Console:   a simple interactive console to embed in your
                          application
